# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Raja!

Welcome to my GitHub! I build tools and systems to make development and data interaction more efficient.

### ðŸ§° Highlights from `Rlib`:
- **Tool Building**: Reusable libraries for file I/O, path handling, data structures, etc.
- **Interactive GUIs**: Dynamic data explorers using `ipywidgets` in Jupyter.
- **Data Management**: Custom CRUD systems and storage abstractions.
- **Code Analysis**: Python AST parsing for structure and dependency analysis.
- **Long-Term Projects**: Iterative development across years (`timeline/t2022`, etc.).
- **Eclectic Problem Solving**: Utilities for AI, image processing, and more.
- **Cross-Tech Integration**: Support for C++, JavaScript, and Java tools.
